    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;"><b> The Golden Retriever Blog</b></h1>
    <p>The <b><i>Golden Retriever</i></b> is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a
        gentle and
        affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently
        registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials;
        it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog. The breed was created by Sir Dudley
        Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century.
        He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter,
        Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar
        period spread to many parts of the world.</p>
    <p>The <b><i>Golden Retriever</i></b> was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks
        (later to
        become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some
        other British dog breeds.[2][3] Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had been
        meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of the
        breed.[2]</p>
